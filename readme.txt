Proxyeconomics Agent based model

The model is written in Python3.7 using the 'Mesa' Package. 
I use 'Anaconda' environment manager and 'spyder3.3.6' editor.

To install Mesa:
in the Anaonda Prompt run: pip install Mesa
(note that this is case-sensitive)

Then load and run: ProxyModel1.py

Then to run a family of models load and run eg.: run_ProxyModel_competition.py
